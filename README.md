## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Arteen. I'm an undergraduate at UCLA studying Computer Science and Math.

I like low-level details and learning about the intricacies of any piece of software I'm working on.

I recently worked on machine compilers at Arm. Merged [one](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pull/108260) and [two](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pull/108133) into LLVM. I also worked on some other stuff, which should be open-sourced in the next year or so.

I'm also actively wrapping up some research on computer architecture with Professor Nowatzki (UCLA). Stay tuned for updates.
