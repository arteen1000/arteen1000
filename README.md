## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Arteen. I'm an undergraduate at UCLA studying Computer Science and Math.

I like low-level details and learning about the intricacies of any piece of software I'm working on.

I recently worked on machine compilers at Arm this past summer. Merged [one](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pull/108260) and [two](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pull/108133) into LLVM. I also worked on some other stuff, which should be open-sourced in the next year or so.

I also worked at American Airlines previously, working on full-stack development.

I also am working on some computer architecture research with Professor Nowatzki at UCLA. Stay tuned for updates on that.
