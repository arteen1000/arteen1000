## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Arteen, an undergraduate at UCLA studying Computer Science and Math.

I like low-level details and learning about the intricacies of any piece of software I'm working on.

Recently, I worked on machine learning compilers at Arm. Merged [one](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pull/108260) and [two](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pull/108133) into LLVM. I also worked on some other projects, which should be open-sourced in the next year or so.

Currently, I'm wrapping up some research on computer architecture with Professor Nowatzki, serving as a learning assistant for computer organization, recruiting for internships, and finishing up my degree.
